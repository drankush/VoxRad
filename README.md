# üöÄ VOXRAD 

VOXRAD is a voice transcription application for radiologists leveraging voice transcription and large language models to restructure and format reports as per predefined user instruction templates.

**Welcome to The VOXRAD App! üåü üéô**

This application leverages the power of generative AI to efficiently transcribe and format radiology reports from audio inputs. Designed for radiologists and radiology residents, it transforms spoken content into structured, readable reports.

**Etymology:**

-  **VoxRad** /v…íks-r√¶d/ *noun*

1. A portmanteau derived from **Vox** (Latin for *voice*) and **Rad** (*radiology*), symbolizing the fusion of voice recognition with radiology. Represents the integration of voice recognition technology with radiological imaging and reporting.

2. An AI-driven app transforming radiology reporting through voice transcription, enhancing accuracy in medical documentation.

## ‚ú® Features 

- üé§ Voice transcription
- üìù Report formatting
- ü§ñ Integration with large language models
- ‚öôÔ∏è Customizable templates
- üìà Potential to extend the application for dictating other structured notes (discharge notes, OT notes or legal paperwork)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

<i>Modified figure from Ankush et al. for v0.4.0-beta [1]</i>
</p>

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Set Up

### üíª Installation 

- Download the `.app` file for Mac or the `.exe` file for Windows from the [releases](https://github.com/drankush/voxrad/releases).

### üîÑ Understanding Workflow
VOXRAD uses two ways to transcribe audio to report.

- Use a combination of using a transcription model to first transcribe audio and then format and restructure the transcript using instruction template.
- Use a multimodal model to directly input the audio and instruction template to provide output (experimental).

Read more about the supported models [here](https://voxrad.gitbook.io/voxrad/fundamentals/getting-set-up/understanding-workflow#supported-llms).

### üìÑ Customizing Templates and Guidelines

- Click ‚öôÔ∏è Settings button at bottom right corner of the application interface.

  -  In the first Tab  üõ† General click Browse and select your desired working directory. 

  -  Here your templates files (predefined CoT-like systematic instructions such as HRCT_Thorax.txt, CT_Head.txt etc.) and guidelines (such as BIRADS.md, TIRADS.md, PIRADS.md etc.) will be kept.

Read more about [Customizing templates and guidelines](https://voxrad.gitbook.io/voxrad/fundamentals/getting-set-up/customizing-templates).


### üîê Managing Keys

- You can encrypt keys of transcription, text and multimodal models with password and even lock and unlock them while the application is in use. The application will ask for this password every time you start the applicaiton if encrypted keys are stored.
- In the "Base URL" field,  enter the base URL in OpenAI compatible format. Enter API key in the in the "API Key" field.
- You can use any OpenAI-compatible API key and Base URL and even locally deployed models which create OpenAI compatible endpoints.
- Click **Fetch Model** to see the available models and choose one.
- Click **Save Settings** to save your selected model and Base URL (these are not encrypted).
Read more about managing keys, best practices and troubleshooting [here](https://voxrad.gitbook.io/voxrad/fundamentals/getting-set-up/managing-keys).

### üñ•Ô∏è Running Models Locally

- There are [various ways](https://voxrad.gitbook.io/voxrad/running-models-locally) to run models locally and create OpenAI compatible endpoints which can then used with this application.
- You can also input OpenAI compatible Base URL and API key of [any remotely hosted service](https://voxrad.gitbook.io/voxrad/running-models-locally#remotely-hosted-models), however this is not recommended for sensitive data. For example: Groq: https://api.groq.com/openai/v1

## üñ±Ô∏è Usage 

### üéô Main App Window 

<!--

  <img src="images/voxrad_gui.jpg" alt="VOXRAD Logo" />
</p>
-->



- Press the **Record üî¥** button and start dictating your report, keep it around max 15 minutes, as the file sent limit is 25 MB (the application will try to reduce the bitrate to accommodate this size for longer audios). You will see a waveform while the audio is recorded.

- Press **Stop ‚¨úÔ∏è** to stop recording. Your audio will be processed.

- The final formatted and structured report will be automatically posted on your clipboard. You can then directly paste using secure paste shortcut key defined in the General Settings (in macOS) or  (Ctrl + V in windows application) it into your application, word processor, or PACS.
