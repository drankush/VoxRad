## TIRADS Guidelines for Thyroid Ultrasound: Recommendations Framework

This document outlines how to derive recommendations based on findings from thyroid ultrasound reports using the TIRADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System) guidelines. The recommendations will be structured according to the findings/impressions categorized by TIRADS.

### 1. Understanding TIRADS Categories

TIRADS categorizes thyroid nodules based on ultrasound characteristics, which aids in assessing the risk of malignancy. The categories are typically defined as follows:

- **TIRADS 1**: Benign - No further action required.
- **TIRADS 2**: Not suspicious - Follow-up as per clinical judgment.
- **TIRADS 3**: Mildly suspicious - Consider follow-up imaging.
- **TIRADS 4**: Moderately suspicious - Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) recommended.
- **TIRADS 5**: Highly suspicious - FNA or surgical intervention recommended.

### 2. Recommendations Based on Findings

The following structured approach is designed to help a language model (LLM) generate recommendations based on specific findings in ultrasound reports:

#### **A. Findings Indicating TIRADS Categories**

1. **TIRADS 1 Findings**
   - Characteristics: Cystic nodules without solid components.
   - **Recommendation**: No action required; routine follow-up unless clinical symptoms arise.

2. **TIRADS 2 Findings**
   - Characteristics: Solid nodules with benign features (e.g., isoechoic).
   - **Recommendation**: Clinical correlation; consider follow-up imaging in 12-24 months if indicated.

3. **TIRADS 3 Findings**
   - Characteristics: Solid nodules with some suspicious features (e.g., microcalcifications).
   - **Recommendation**: Follow-up imaging in 6-12 months; consider FNA if there are changes.

4. **TIRADS 4 Findings**
   - Characteristics: Solid nodules with moderate suspicion (e.g., irregular margins, taller than wide).
   - **Recommendation**: Perform FNA to evaluate for malignancy; discuss results with a specialist.

5. **TIRADS 5 Findings**
   - Characteristics: Solid nodules with high suspicion (e.g., marked hypoechogenicity, microcalcifications).
   - **Recommendation**: Urgent FNA or surgical evaluation recommended; refer to an endocrinologist or surgeon for management.

### 3. Additional Considerations

- **Patient History**: Always consider the patient's clinical history, including family history of thyroid cancer and previous thyroid conditions.
- **Nodule Size**: Larger nodules (>1 cm) with suspicious features should be prioritized for FNA regardless of TIRADS classification.
- **Follow-Up Protocols**: Establish a follow-up protocol based on initial findings and patient risk factors.

### 4. Conclusion

This structured approach allows healthcare professionals to generate clear and actionable recommendations based on TIRADS classifications derived from ultrasound findings. By adhering to these guidelines, the management of thyroid nodules can be standardized, improving patient outcomes and minimizing unnecessary procedures.
